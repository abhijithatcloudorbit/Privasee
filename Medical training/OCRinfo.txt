In this pipeline, text extraction is handled through a dual-OCR strategy to maximize accuracy. 
Tesseract is used as the primary OCR engine because it provides detailed word-level bounding boxes 
through image_to_data, which helps in precisely locating and anonymizing sensitive text. 

If Tesseract fails to detect text properly—due to low-quality images, stylized fonts, 
or rotated content—the system automatically switches to EasyOCR as the fallback engine. 

EasyOCR handles noisy, handwritten, and non-standard fonts better, ensuring that text is 
still captured even when Tesseract misses it. This combined approach improves robustness and
 reduces the chance of unblurred sensitive information.
