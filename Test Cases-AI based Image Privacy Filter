1. Functional Test Cases
Test Case ID	Test Scenario	Input	Expected Output	Industry / Use Case
F1	Detect and blur human faces	Image with multiple people	All faces blurred; background intact	Healthcare / Automotive
F2	Detect license plates in dashcam feed	Road video footage	License plates blurred, rest visible	Automotive
F3	Mask textual identifiers (e.g., names, IDs)	Document scan / patient record	Text fields redacted or blurred	Healthcare / Insurance
F4	Process batch images through API	50 test images uploaded via API	All outputs privacy-filtered and downloadable	SaaS Cloud API
F5	Handle unsupported file types	TIFF file input	Display “Unsupported format” error	All
