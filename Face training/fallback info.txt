YOLOv8n-face is the main face detector. It provides highly accurate face
detection, handles multiple faces, rotated faces, and small faces. No
training is needed.

OpenCV DNN SSD face detector is the fallback method. It is used only if
YOLO fails. It is faster but less accurate than YOLO. It uses a
MobileNet-based SSD model.

YOLOv8n-face = primary detector. OpenCV SSD = backup detector.

Haar Cascade face detector is the final fallback method. It is 
used only if both YOLO and SSD fail to detect a face. It is the 
oldest and fastest detector but less accurate. It works well on small, 
low-resolution, or simple front-facing faces. Including Haar Cascade ensures 
that some face detection still happens even when the deep-learning detectors cannot
run or fail to detect anything.

Fallback is included to ensure face detection works even if the main
model fails to load.

Flow Used in Code:
Try YOLOv8n-face → If not available, try DNN SSD → If not available, try Haar Cascade
